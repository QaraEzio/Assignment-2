		Ngapali Beach
	
	</h1>
	
	<p style="font-size: 25px;font-family:Sitka Display;color: azure;">Ngapali Beach is one of the great attractions in Myanmar and the most beautiful beach in Myanmar. Located about 7 km from Thandwe, in Rakhine State, Ngapali beach is beautiful stretches of sand on the Gulf of Bengal. Being isolated for a long time along with well preserved by the local people, nowadays, Ngapali is one of the most enchanting beaches in Asia, well-known as the gem of Myanmar, itâ€™s blue water, the km-long white sand beach has made the beach one of the precious gifts from Mother Nature.The stretches of sand are uncrowded and largely unspoilt so much so that this region could be deemed as one of the last true hidden gems of Southeast Asia. Ngapali Beach has spectacular sunsets; little islets are accessible as the tide goes down making for beautiful pictures if the timing is right, although it looks stunning hightide too. 

		What's particularly good about staying around the Ngapali Beach area is that the streetside vendors don't bother you much at all, unlike some counterparts in Thailand for example. The locals very much enhance your experience at Ngapali Beach as there are little stalls near to the beach itself selling fresh coconut for the thirsty or Burmese snacks for those a little peckish. There are also nearby fishing villages that can be visited for those wanting to balance relaxation and discovery.</p>
